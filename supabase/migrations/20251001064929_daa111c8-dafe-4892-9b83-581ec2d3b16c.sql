  '# Tempo Runs vs Interval Training: When to Use Each

If you''re looking to get faster, stronger, and more efficient as a runner, you''ve probably heard of tempo runs and interval training. Both workouts improve performance, but they do so in different ways. Understanding when to use each can take your trainingâ€”and your race resultsâ€”to the next level.

## What Is a Tempo Run?

A tempo run (also called a threshold run) is a sustained effort at a "comfortably hard" paceâ€”faster than an easy jog but not all-out sprinting. Most runners describe it as a pace you could hold for about an hour in a race.

**Benefits of tempo runs:**

- Improve lactate threshold (your ability to run faster without fatigue)
- Build mental toughness by running steadily under stress
- Great for 5K to marathon training

**Example:** 20 minutes at tempo pace after a warm-up, followed by a cool-down jog.

## What Is Interval Training?

Intervals are short bursts of faster running followed by recovery periods. They can range from 30-second sprints to 5-minute efforts, depending on your goals.

**Benefits of intervals:**

- Boost VOâ‚‚ max (your body''s oxygen capacity)
- Develop speed and running economy
- Add variety and intensity to training

**Example:** 6 Ã— 400m at 5K pace with 90 seconds walking or jogging between reps.

> "Tempo runs train you to go longer. Intervals train you to go faster."

## When to Use Tempo Runs

Use tempo runs when you''re:

- Preparing for longer races (10K, half marathon, marathon)
- Building stamina and endurance
- Practicing even pacing and mental focus

Tempo runs are especially effective in the middle stages of a training cycle, when you''re building sustained strength for race day.

## When to Use Interval Training

Use interval workouts when you''re:

- Training for shorter races (5K or 10K)
- Improving leg turnover and speed
- Breaking through plateaus with intensity

Intervals are best sprinkled once a week during a training cycleâ€”enough to challenge your system without overtraining.

### Did You Know?

Studies show that combining tempo runs and intervals in a training plan can improve race performance by up to 5â€“10% more than doing either workout alone.

## How to Balance Both

- **Beginners:** Start with tempo runs to build a base, then add intervals later.
- **Intermediate runners:** Alternate weeksâ€”tempo one week, intervals the next.
- **Advanced runners:** Include one tempo and one interval workout per week, with easy runs and rest days in between.

## Final Motivation

Tempo runs and intervals are powerful toolsâ€”but the real magic is knowing when to use each. Tempo runs build endurance and focus, while intervals sharpen speed and efficiency. Together, they create a balanced runner who can go farther and faster.
